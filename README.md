This repository houses the python code for my basic explorations for the realtor.com housing data for Kingston NY. The realtor.com data file is not housed in this repository, and the code is meant to read a csv file in it's own folder. So if you're interested in running the code with the original CSV file, you could reach out to me. Otherwise, the repository is available primarily to check out the code. You can see the visualizations at https://oroconnor.github.io/td/
